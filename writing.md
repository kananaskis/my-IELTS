**some people think that** music can be as a wide but enjoyable method which bring people, who has different cultural backgrounds and age gap, together. **While I do agree with the idea that** music is a excellent way of bringing people from different cultures together, **I don't think that** it will play a part between people of different ages.

**There are several reasons why** I believe that music is a good way bring people of different cultures together. **Firstly**, It's very common that people come from different countries and have different cultural background prefer the same kind of music or the same musician or singer. **For example**, the people from China may be love British classical music the same as the people from the United States, even though they live in different cultural contexts/settings. **Secondly**, AS a form of arts and cultures, music is the common wealth of human being and all over the world; it does not the particular country's belonging. **Finally**, music plays an important role in culture communication; a new type of music can be formed by learning other countries' music culture，and by listening other countries’ music，people can learn other cultures so as to get people more together.

**In my opinion, I don't think** music is an good and effective way put different ages people together. **(explain why)** People of different age stages may be prefer different kinds of music. **(example)** Young people are more like pop-music and rock-music, and older people are more likely fond of classical music, and children and baby are prefer Nursery rhymes. **Furthermore**, to understand some music need particular knowledge, especially classical music. **(explain why)** It's difficult for younger people and children to master this knowledge.

**In conclusion, my view is that** music is an excellent way to bringing people of different culture settings, but it may be not an effective way of get different ages people together.

The line graph compares the amount/quantities of goods transported in the UK by four different kinds/modes of transport over a period of 28 years. 

It is clear that road was by far the most important modes of goods transported over the period show. Pipeline provided the lowest amount of transport in each year. 
In 1974, the road transport was the main modes of transport in UK, having around 70 million tonnes of goods. Water and rail mode transported quite close, just no more than 40 million tonnes of goods each, and pipeline provided a negligible amount. Around four our years later, in 1978, water transport overtook water transport as the secondary modes of transport.

Between 1974 and 2002, goods transported by road rose dramatically to a peak around 100 million tonnes, keeping the most quantity of goods transported/ the primary mode of transport in four modes. By contrast, the figure for rail transport fell to less than 30 million tonnes in 1995, and later rose to 40 million tonnes as beginning. Water transport amount remained relatively stable from 1980 to 1998, at between 50 and 60 million tonnes, for around 18-year period, and pipeline transport amount saw no decrease / stable rise, keeping stable rise to more than 20 million tonnes by 2012.
