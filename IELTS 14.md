- so, may ask where you're staying now?
- well in present i've get a place at part apartments that's on king **street**. i was staying at the riverside apartments on the same street, but the apartment there was onlt available for six weeks, so i had to find an other one.

- new i need to take some details of the theft. so you said you had somethings stolen out of your bag?
- that right.

- yes, so you said the theft **occurred** yesterday?
- yes.
- so that was **september** the tenth. and do you have any idea at all of where or when the things might **posiblly** have been stolen?
- well, at first i couldn't **believe** it because the bag had been on my pack ever since i left the apartment after lunch. it's just a small backpack, but i **generally** use it when i **travelling** because it seems safer than a handbag. anyway, i met up with a firend, and we spent a couple of hours in the **museum**. but i do **remember** that as we were leaving there, at about 4 oclock, a group of young boys ran up to us, and they are really **crowding** round us and they were asking us what time it was, then all of a **sudden**, they all ran off.
- can you remember anything about them?
- the one who did most of the talkin was wearing a **T'shirt** whith a  picture of something, let see...a tiger.
- righr, any idea how might him have been?
- around **twelve** years old?

- right. so what i am going  to do now is give your a crime reference num, so your can **contact** to your insurance company. so this is ten **digits**, 87954 82361.
- thank you.

# Test 2
good morning everyone. my name is xx, and i am the human **resources** manager. we are very happy to welcome you to your new **apprenticeship(学徒期)**. i hope that the next six months will be a positive and enjoyable **experience** for you.   
i'd like to start with some general **advice** about being an apprentice. most of you have very little or have no experience of working for a big organization, and  the first week or so may be quite **challenging**. there will be a lot of new **information** to *take in*, but don't worry too much about try to remember everything. the important thing is to check with someone if you're not sure what to do. you'll find you **supervisor** is very **approachable(和蔼可亲的)** and **won't mind explaining things or helping you out.**  you're here to learn so make the most of that opportunity. you'll be spendind time in difference **departments** during your first week so make an **effort** to talk to as many pepole as possible about their work. you'll make some new firends and find out lots of useful information.   
as well as having a supervisor, you'll each be **assigned** a mentor. this person will be someone **who's recently completed an apprenticeship and you'll meet with them on a weekly basis.** their role is to **provide help and support** throughout you apprenticeship. of course this doesn't mean they'll actually do any of your work for you, **instead** they'll be **asking you about what goals you've achieved so far as well as helping you to identify any areas for improvement.** you can also discuss your more long-term **ambitions** with them as well.   
now i just want to **run through(匆匆浏览)** a few company polices for our **apprenticeship scheme** with you.   
- most importly, the internet. as part of your job, you will be doing some research online, so **obviously** you'll have unlimited access for that, but please don't use it for personal use, you'll have your won phone for that.
- some of you have already asked me about **flexible working**. after your **probationary(试用的)** three-months **period**, some of you will be **eligible(有资格的)** for this, but it will **depend on** which department you're in and what your personal **circumstances(境况)** are. so please don't **assume** you'll **automatically** be **permitted** to do this.
- i want to make sure there's no confusion about our holiday policy. aprat from any **statutory public holidays(法定公共假日)** we ask that you don't **book any holidays(预订假日)** until after your six months apprenticeship has finished. **time off(休假) should only be taken if are unwell(抱恙).** please speak to you surperisor if this is going to be a problem.
- you'll be expected to work a 40-hour week, but there maybe opportunity to do overtime during **busy periods**. although you're not **required to do** this, it can be a **valuable experience**. so we advise you to take it up if **possible**. obviously, we understand that people do have **commitments** outside work, so don't worry if there are times when you are unavailable.
- as you know, we don't have a **formal dress code** here, you may wear **casual clothes** as long as they're practical, and the only restriction for shoes we have is on high heels for health and safety reasons. comfortable shoes like **trainers(运动鞋)** are preferable.
- there's a **heavily subsidised canteen(高补贴食堂)** on site where you can get hot milk or **salads** cheaply. **snacks** and drink are also provided, so we **decided to** introduce a **no packed lunch** policy. this is partly to encourage **healthy** eating at work, and partly to stop people from eating at their worksatation which is **unhygienic**.
